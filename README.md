Singularity can mean different things depending on the context. Here are the main ones, from general to technical:

1️⃣ Technological Singularity (most common today)

The technological singularity is a hypothetical point in time when:

Artificial intelligence becomes more intelligent than humans

AI can improve itself recursively

Technological progress becomes uncontrollable and irreversible

After this point, human society would change so radically that we can’t predict what happens next.

Key ideas

AI designs better AI → exponential intelligence growth

Human decision-making becomes secondary

Jobs, economy, science, and even biology change dramatically
